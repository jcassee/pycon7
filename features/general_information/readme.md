Registro Navale uses a resource-based API that uses the Hypertext Application Language (HAL) media format. HAL provides a standard way for expressing the resources and relationships of an API as hyperlinks. With HAL, you use HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) to submit requests and receive information about the API in the response. Applications can use the information returned to explore the functionality of the API.

For more information about HAL, see its [Home Page](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) or the [Internet Draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal).

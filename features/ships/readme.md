The core functionality of the Registro Navale API is to look up information about ships. If you know a ship's [IMO-number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMO_number) you can access the information directly through the `ship-by-imo` relation from the root resource. Otherwise, you can use the `search-ships` relation to search for the ship.
